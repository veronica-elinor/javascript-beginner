## Introduction to JavaScript
### What can JavaScript do?
- Web/ Mobile Apps
- Real-time Networking Apps
- Command-line Tools
- Games

### Where does JavaScript run?
> Originally designed to run in **BROWSERS**
##### (v.s php run on server)
##### JavaScript Engine
- Firefox: Spider Monkey
- Chrome: V8
> In 2009, Ryan Dahl took the open-source JavaScript engine in CHrome and embbedded it inside a C++ program. He called that program "Node".
> "Node" is a C++ program that includes Google V8. As a result of that, we can run JavaScript outside a browser. Thus we can build the backend for web/ mobile app in JavaScript.

### JavaScript v.s ECMAScript
- ECMAScript: A specification, defining standards
- JavaScript: A programming language

### Write JavaScript on Chrome
1. Open a new tab, click on right then choose "inspect"
2. Choose "console", and now you can write JavaScript code
3. You can change the JavaScript code in your HTML page, but it won't change the file.

### Best place to put JavaScript code is ```html <body> ``` tag
### Separation of concerns: build a .js file

### const 常數
> 不可改
